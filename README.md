# Mission-To-Mars

## Overview of the project

This project's goal is to build a web application that scrapes multiple websites for data relevant to the Mission to Mars and displays it in a single HTML page.


## Scraping
We scraped the internet with Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter to obtain material.

## App Build
MongoDB with Flask templating was used to create a new HTML page to display all of the information into a responsive web app.
